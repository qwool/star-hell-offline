# game thing
[x] fix xp orb pull
[x] make stats modular
[x] fix hp bar
[x] add an entity cap
[x] sometimes ur given the same upgrades twice
[x] add iframes to all hitboxes
[x] enemies sometiems spawn right on me
[x] the hp completely bugged otu around lvl 10
[x] damage per level doesnt work
[x] pickup range isnt tied to speed
[x] i maxed out a bit too fast
[ ] add more enemies
[x] background cuts off
[ ] make it so elemental applies before everything else to explode even on one hit
[ ] hitmarkers

## necessary
[ ] make the lobby and gun parts menu
[ ] game icon and name

## major
[ ] add camera shake sometimes
[ ] more explosions
[ ] on upgrades instead of wheel draw 4 cards

upgrade routes:
  4 gun parts and 4 upgrades for each, unlocked for points and achievements
  every gun part upgrade type is for different types
  3 classes: elemental, berserk and explosion + tank

gun parts are gonna be:
  trigger for cooldown
  mag for speed and ammo
  hammer for effects
  barrel for damage


points scheme:
  enemy killed +1 point
  level +10 points
  5 seconds is one point
  so a starter upgrade should be about 500
